Personal Masters in Data Science

If I were to create a Personal Masters Program in Data Science, I would include the following resources which are ABSOLUTELY FREE.

* The [Missing Semester](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuXy5tCgEninup9cGplbiFw/playlists) contains tutorials on tools like `git`, `data wrangling`, `shell` etc which are used almost daily. They also have course notes if you dont want to watch hour-long videos.
